		<h1>Rules for the Implementation of ROMCAL</h1>
	</center>

	<h2>General</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>The Church document governing the Calendar is <i><a
				href="http://www.romcal.net/norms.html">General Norms for the
					Liturgical Year and the Calendar</a></i>, dated March 21, 1969. This was
			published following the approval of the new Roman Calendar by Paul IV
			in <i><a href="http://www.romcal.net/mysterii.html">Mysterii
					Paschalis</a></i> on February 14, 1969. The authority for this <i>motu
				proprio</i> was <i><a href="http://www.romcal.net/liturgy.html">Sacrosanctum
					Concilium</a></i>, the Constitution of the Sacred Liturgy, issued by the
			Second Vatican Council on December 4, 1963.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The types of observances of the General Roman Calendar in
			order of precedence are:</li>

		<ul>
			<li> Christmas/Easter</li>

			<li> Octave of
				Easter/Holy Week</li>

			<li> Ash Wednesday</li>

			<li> Sundays of
				Advent, Lent &amp; Easter</li>

			<li> Movable Solemnity</li>

			<li> Fixed Solemnity
				(transferred if on Sunday of Advent or Lent)</li>

			<li> Feasts of the
				Lord</li>

			<li> Sundays of
				Ordinary Time &amp; Christmas</li>

			<li> Feasts</li>

		<br>&nbsp;
		<li>If a fixed date Solemnity occurs on a Sunday of Lent or
			Advent, the Solemnity is transferred to the following Monday.&nbsp;
			This affects Joseph, Husband of Mary (Mar 19), Annunciation (Mar 25),
			and Immaculate Conception (Dec 8).&nbsp; It is not possible for a

	<h4>Christmas</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Christmas occurs on December 25. The weekday of Christmas can
			be found by computing the date of Easter (which is of course on a
			Sunday), and counting the number of days between Easter and
			Christmas, modulo 7.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>If Christmas falls on a Sunday, then Holy Family is
			celebrated on Dec. 30.&nbsp; Otherwise, Holy Family is the Sunday
			after Christmas.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Epiphany</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>The rubrics of <i>Christian Prayer: The Liturgy of the
				Hours</i> state:
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<ul>&nbsp;"Where the solemnity of Epiphany is celebrated on the
			Sunday between January 2 and January 8, the proper parts are taken
			from below, unless January 7 or 8 occurs on Sunday in which case
			Ordinary Time begins on the following day, the feast of the Baptism
			of the Lord being omitted."
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>However, on October 7, 1977, the Congregation for the
			Sacraments and Divine Worship issued the decree <i><a
				href="http://www.romcal.net/baptism.html">Celebratio Baptismatis
					Domini</a></i> which directed the following:
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<ul>
			"In places where the solemnity of the Epiphany is to be transferred
			to the Sunday falling on 7 January or 8 January, with the result that
			the feast of the Baptism of the Lord would be omitted, this feast is
			to be transferred to the Monday immediately following that Sunday."
			<p>Version 1 of ROMCAL implemented the original rubric. Versions
				2 and following implement the correct rubric.</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>If Epiphany is celebrated on Jan. 6:</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<ol>
			<li>Jan. 1 is the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God.</li>

			<li>Days from Jan. 2 through Jan. 5 are called "*day before
				Epiphany".</li>

			<li>If a Sunday occurs on a day from Jan. 2 through Jan. 5, it
				is called the "Second Sunday of Christmas".</li>

			<li>Epiphany is celebrated on Jan. 6.</li>

			<li>Days between Jan. 6 and the following Sunday are called
				"*day after Epiphany".</li>

			<li>The Baptism of the Lord occurs on the Sunday following Jan.
				6.</li>

			<li>Ordinary time begins on the day after the Baptism of the
				Lord.</li>
		</ol>
		ROMCAL implements these rules with the -e option.
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>If Epiphany is not celebrated on Jan. 6 (i.e., celebrated on
			Sunday):</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<ol>
			<li>Jan. 1 is the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God.</li>

			<li>Days after Jan. 1 but before the Sunday occurring from Jan.
				2 through Jan. 8 are called "*day before Epiphany".</li>

			<li>Epiphany is celebrated on the Sunday occurring from Jan. 2
				through Jan. 8.</li>

			<li>If Epiphany occurs on Jan. 7 or Jan. 8, then the Baptism of
				the Lord is the next day (Monday)</li>

			<li>If Epiphany occurs on or before Jan. 6, then the days of the
				week following Epiphany are called "*day after Epiphany" and the
				Sunday following Epiphany is the Baptism of the Lord.</li>

			<li>Ordinary time begins on the day after the Baptism of the
				Lord.</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>

	<h2>The Season of Lent &amp; Holy Week</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Ash Wednesday occurs 46 days before Easter.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>If the Annunciation (Mar 25) falls on Palm Sunday, it is
			celebrated on the Saturday preceding. If it falls during Holy Week or
			within the Octave of Easter, the Annunciation is transferred to the
			Monday of the Second Week of Easter. Versions of ROMCAL prior to
			version 4 always moved it to the Monday of the Second Week of Easter.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>If Joseph, Husband of Mary (Mar 19) falls on Palm Sunday or
			during Holy Week, it is moved to the Saturday preceding Palm Sunday.
			This was first addressed in the Decree <i><a
				href="http://www.romcal.net/joseph.html">Cum Proximo Anno</a></i> issued
			in 1966. Versions of ROMCAL prior to version 4 incorrectly moved it
			to the Monday of the Second Week of Easter, where it was overwritten
			by the Annunciation.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>If a fixed date Memorial or Optional Memorial falls within
			the Lenten season, it is reduced in rank to a Commemoration.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The Season of Easter &amp; Pentecost</h2>

	<h4>Easter</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Easter follows a complicated formula for its determination.
			The Ecumenical Council of Nicea passed the following canon</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<ul>"That everywhere the great feast of Easter should be observed
			upon one and the same day; and that not the day of the Jewish
			Passover, but, as had been generally observed, upon the Sunday
			afterwards."
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The Council also laid down these rules:</li>
	</ul>

	<ol>
		<ol>
			<li>That the twenty-first day of March shall be accounted the
				vernal equinox.</li>

			<li>That the full moon happening upon or next after the
				twenty-first of March, shall be taken for the full moon of Nisan.</li>

			<li>That the Lord's-day next following that full moon be
				Easter-day.</li>

			<li>But if the full moon happen upon a Sunday, Easter-day shall
				be the Sunday after.</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>

	<ul>
		<li>ROMCAL uses an algorithm from <i>The Explanatory
				Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac</i> published by the U.S. Naval
			Observatory. The algorithm is attributed to Oudin, J.M. (1940) "Etude
			sur la Date de Paques". <i>Bull. Astronomique</i> (2) vol. 12, pp.
			391-410.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>The Octave of Easter</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Easter and all the days within the Octave of Easter,
			including the Second Sunday of Easter (formerly "Low Sunday") are
			Solemnities.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Ascension</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>The <i>Guide for Christian Prayer (The Liturgy of the
				Hours) for 1995</i> stated:
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<blockquote>"In the following states [of the United
			States], Ascension is transferred from Thursday to the Seventh Sunday
			of Easter:&nbsp; Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
			Oregon, Utah, [and] Washington."</blockquote>

		<li>In 1999, an <a href="http://www.romcal.net/ascension.html">Indult
				for the Transfer of the Solemnity of the Ascension</a> was issued by the
			United States Conference of Catholic Bishops allowing each
			ecclesiastical province to determine if the Ascension should be
			celebrated on its proper Thursday (39 days after Easter) or on the
			Seventh Sunday of Easter (42 days after Easter). The following
			provinces of the United States have retained the celebration of
			Ascension on its proper Thursday. All other provinces of the United
			States have transferred the celebration of the Ascension to the
			Seventh Sunday of Easter. ROMCAL will move Ascension to the Seventh
			Sunday of Easter with the -a option.

	<h4>Pentecost, Trinity Sunday, and Corpus Christi</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>The Solemnity of Pentecost occurs 49 days after Easter.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The Solemnity of Trinity Sunday occurs 56 days after Easter.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The Solemnity of Corpus Christi occurs 60 days after Easter,
			if it is celebrated on Thursday of the Seventh Week of Easter. In
			those places where Corpus Christi is not a holyday, it is transferred
			to the following Sunday (63 days after Easter). ROMCAL will place the
			celebration of Corpus Christi on Thursday with the -c option.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Sacred Heart of Jesus and Immaculate Heart of Mary</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>The Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus occurs 68 days
			after Easter.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Immaculate Heart of Mary occurs 69 days after Easter and is a
			Memorial. This was formerly an Optional Memorial.</li>
	</ul>

	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			"Formerly an optional memorial, the celebration of the Immaculate
			Heart of Mary has been raised to the rank of an obligatory memorial
			in the General Roman Calendar by a decree of the Congregation for
			Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (24 May 1996)." <br>--
			<i>Paulist Press Ordo for 2000</i>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>The Season of Ordinary Time</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Ordinary Time in the early part of the year begins the day
			after the Baptism of the Lord and concludes the day before Ash
			Wednesday.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Ordinary Time in the later part of the year begins the day
			after Pentecost and concludes the day before the First Sunday of
			Advent.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The Solemnity of Christ the King is always the 34th (and
			last) Sunday of Ordinary Time and is the week before the First Sunday
			of Advent. The Sundays of Ordinary Time in the latter part of the
			year are numbered backwards from Christ the King to Pentecost.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Liturgical Colors</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color of the Advent and Lent seasons is purple.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color of the Easter and Christmas seasons is
			white.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color of Ordinary Time is green.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color of a Commemoration is the color of the
			season.&nbsp; As Commemorations only occur during Lent, their proper
			color is purple.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color of an Optional Memorial is the color of the
			season.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color of a Memorial or a Feast is white except for
			martyrs in which case it is red.&nbsp; The proper color for the Chair
			of Peter (Feast, Feb 22) and the Conversion of St. Paul (Feast, Jan
			25) is white, although both St. Peter and St. Paul were martyrs.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color for Solemnities is white except Pentecost
			and Peter and Paul (Jun 29) in which cases it is red.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color for Feasts of the Lord is white except the
			Triumph of the Cross in which case it is red.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The proper color of the Third Sunday of Advent and the Fourth
			Sunday of Lent is rose. Purple may also be used on these Sundays.</li>
